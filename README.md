# Mobile Networking subject related projects
All 3 projects were created as a simple generators of the data we had to analyze, they were also one of my first java projects, 
so i experimented with the GUI. Because of that they could be considered a mess. Since they all served a similar purpose in my
studies, i grouped them together. 

## Technologies
* JDK 8u111

## TODO
While projects 2 and 3 are pretty much worthless outside of what they already provide, project 1 could be excended as such:
* by changing the way a car is seeking the way, more complex neighborhood of the nodes could be introduced
* cleaner interface
* additional parameters outside of the regular roadblock chance
* introduction of the multiple actors on the road for more interesting simulation.
